# Kang-Hsien (Frank) Fan

I started my academic career as a staff cancer biostatistician at the Vanderbilt Center of Quantitative Sciences, Vanderbilt School of Medicine after I received two master’s degrees in biostatistics and bioinformatics in 2010. While being a cancer biostatistician, I have published more than 30 biomedical research articles, including some in top-ranked medical journals, and won the best collaborative publication award based on one of the prostate cancer research papers published in New England Journal of Medicine (2013; 31;368(5):436-445). I received my Ph.D. in Bioinformatics from the University of Georgia in August 2017, and soon after, I joined the Department of Human Genetics, University of Pittsburgh, as a Research Assistant Professor, where I am working on the genetics of Alzheimer's disease (AD). I have analyzed AD data for genome-wide association studies and whole-genome sequencing studies. I am a statistical bioinformatician with expertise in clinical trials and high throughput data analysis, including microarray and sequencing technologies such as whole-genome/whole-exome sequencing and RNA-seq. I mentored over 10 Master's, 5 PhD, and 3 post-doc fellows, supervising genomic research projects in biostatistics and bioinformatics with successful peer-reviewed publications. My research interests are associations between genetic variants and quantitative phenotypic traits, including disease status (GWAS), clinical measurements (QTL), RNA expression (eQTL), and transcript splicing (structure QTL).
